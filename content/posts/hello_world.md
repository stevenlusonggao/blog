I started this blog as a way for me to share my findings on various topics including but not limited to software engineering, crypto, and data science. This below is an overview on some of the posts I'm currently working on.

**Posts in the pipeline:**

- Rust memory efficiency tips
- Tradeoff of using `base64+zstd` vs `base64` encoding in Solana RPC calls.
- Jito `gRPC` calls vs `JSON-RPC` calls
- Solana vanity address grinding

See you soon!
