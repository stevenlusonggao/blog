<h1 class="page-header">About Me</h1>

I'm a software developer and data analyst residing at the intersection of capital markets and technology. I have obtained degrees in both Computer Science and Finance.

After graduating university, I first worked at [DRW](https://www.drw.com/), where I developed and refined real-time event-driven equities trading strategies. 

Afterwards, I joined [YipitData](https://www.yipitdata.com/), a data research provider to hedge funds and investment firms. During my tenure, I transformed complex data into actionable insights for some of the sharpest investors in the world. My research was featured on the [WSJ](https://youtu.be/5YO0oLuVU7w?si=V2ulGcd1dI6hnhCb&t=20). 

I'm currently working on building [BlueBird Genesis](https://bluebirdgenesis.com/), an algorithmic trading firm focused on crypto-assets. 

I'm currently working as a project manager at a cutting-edge AI data company, where I manage projects that collect training data used by frontier AI labs.

We are currently living through the most significant transformation of the capital markets in generations, driven by the advancement of blockchain and AI technologies. I'm committed to making a meaningful impact during this exciting time in history.
