<h1 class="page-header">About Me</h1>

I'm a investment data analyst and software engineer residing at the intersection of capital markets and technology. I'm interested in pursuing opportunities that can utilize my experience in both investment/data research and performant software development.

After studying Computer Science and Business Administration, I worked at [DRW Trading Group](https://www.drw.com/), where I helped develop and refine event-driven trading strategies for equities. Overtime, I got more and more interested in the start-up and entrepreneur scene. 

This led me to join [YipitData](https://www.yipitdata.com/), an emerging alternative data research provider to hedge funds and investment firms. During my tenure, I distilled complex transaction and webscraped data into actionable insights for some of the sharpest investors in the world. Some of my research was also featured on the [WSJ](https://youtu.be/5YO0oLuVU7w?si=V2ulGcd1dI6hnhCb&t=20). 

I eventually founded [BlueBird Genesis](https://bluebirdgenesis.com/), an algorithmic trading firm focused on crypto-assets. I learned alot about the `Rust` programming language and writing performant code needed to sustain latency-sensitive trading systems. 

We are currently living through the most significant transformation of the capital markets in generations, driven by the advancement of blockchain and AI technologies. I'm committed to making a meaningful impact and contributing at the highest level during this exciting time in history.
