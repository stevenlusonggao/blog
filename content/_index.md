<h1 class="page-header">About Me</h1>

I'm a software developer and research analyst residing at the intersection of technology and capital markets. I have two degrees from university, one in Computer Science and one in Finance.

After graduating university, I first worked at [DRW](https://www.drw.com/), where I developed and refined real-time event-driven equities trading strategies. 

Afterwards, I joined [YipitData](https://www.yipitdata.com/), a data research provider to hedge funds and investment firms, where I transformed complex data into actionable investment insights. Some of my research was featured on the [WSJ](https://youtu.be/5YO0oLuVU7w?si=V2ulGcd1dI6hnhCb&t=20). 

I'm currently working on building [BlueBird Genesis](https://bluebirdgenesis.com/), an algorithmic trading firm focused on crypto-assets. 

We are currently living through the most significant transformation of the capital markets in generations, driven by the advancement of blockchain and AI technologies. I'm committed to making a meaningful impact during this exciting time in history.
